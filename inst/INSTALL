This file is intended to help you install LattE and 4ti2 for use in R
through the latte package.







On macOS or unix-alikes

See the GitHub description of the install at
https://github.com/latte-int/latte-distro. Essentially this will just
require pulling down a tarball, extracting the files, navigating into
the directory, and using the standard make sequence of ./configure,
make, make install. Nevertheless, follow the very well-written
instructions on that page.












On Windows

Windows is more challenging because both LattE and 4ti2 demand unix
environments. In the future the Windows connection interface (Cygwin)
will be changed to Docker containers to be significantly more
extensible, lightweight, and easier to install. Nevertheless, the
instructions below show how you can get up and running on a Windows
machine. Feel free to contact david@kahle.io for more any
questions/support!


Step 1: Cygwin part.

• Go to Cygwin website.
• Click Install Cygwin on the left nav bar.
• Click setup-x86.exe and Install from Internet.
• When the "Select Roots Install Directory" page appears, click next.
  (C:\cygwin64 is assumed for this writeup.)
• Click next through until you get to the "Choose A Download Site"
  page.
• Select any mirror (e.g. http://mirrors.kernel.org).
• In the Select Packages screen, 
	* Click the icon to the right of Devel to change it from
	  "Default" to "Install". 
	* Click the icon to the right of Interpreters to change it
	  from "Default" to "Install". 
	* Click the icon to the right of Math to change it from
	  "Default" to "Install". 
	* Click the + icon to the left of Math to expand it and click
	  twice on "3.1.0-1" (or whatever the version is) to change it
	  to "Skip".  
• Click next through everything to complete the download, and then
  install it; this last part takes a while so be ready to wait.
• Once you've installed Cygwin, open it from the start menu.


Step 2: Unzip LattE.

• Go to https://github.com/latte-int/latte/releases.
• Click latte-integrale-1.7.5.tar.gz to download.
• Move the downloaded file (latte-integrale-1.7.5.tar.gz) into your
  Cygwin home directory, for example, from
  C:\Users\david_kahle\Downloads to C:\cygwin64\home\david_kahle\  (Note
  that if you didn't open Cygwin, the user directory (\David_Kahle\)
  won't be there.)



Step 3: In Cygwin.

• Open Cygwin and type "pwd" and enter, the directory listed above
  should come up. (Now as /home/david_kahle, for example.)
• Type "ls" and enter, you should see the latte-integrale-1.7.5.tar.gz
  that you put in from before.
• Type tar -xf latte-integrale-1.7.5.tar.gz
• Type mv latte-integrale-1.7.5 latte (this renames the directory to
  latte)
• Type cd latte 
• Type ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --disable-lidia
• Type make (this takes a very long time to work, so be ready to wait)
(• Type make install)
• Type ls -al bin, you should see a relatively long list of stuff that
  includes count.exe (this is part of LattE) and markov.exe (this is
  part of 4ti2).  If not, something went wrong.

The executables are then made in the directory $HOME/latte/bin



Step 4: Set the system path to include the new executables.

• Edit the system path by the following:
	* Right click the My Computer icon on the desktop.  Click
	  "Advanced system settings" on the left nav bar, and then
	  click Environment Variables under the Advanced tab (the
	  window should be labeled System Properties).
	* Under System variables, click Path, then Edit...
	* To the beginning of the path string, add
	  "C:\cygwin64\bin;C:\cygwin64\home\david_kahle\latte\bin;"
	* Click Ok, Ok, and Ok, to get rid of all the windows.      



Step 5: Inside R.

• Open R (the x64 version), and inside R type
  install.packages("latte") at the prompt and enter.  If you want the
  dev version, see the instructions at https://github.com/dkahle/latte.
• Type library(latte)
• If you see a message saying that latte and/or 4ti2 are not found,
  use set_latte_path() and/or set_4ti2_path() to tell R where those
  files are. (Note: this will be changed later using environment
  variables.). If you use one of those functions, navigate to where you
  created the executables. This is probably something like
  C:\cygwin64\home\David_Kahle\latte\bin. If you're setting the LattE
  path, click count.exe and ok; if 4ti2, click markov.exe and ok.
• To check that the 4ti2 connection is made, type ?markov and run the
  first few examples; i.e.
	(A <- rbind(
	  kprod(diag(3), ones(1,3)),
	  kprod(ones(1,3), diag(3))
	))
	markov(A)
  You shouldn't get any errors.
• To check that the LattE connection is made, type ?count and run the
  first few examples there; namely
	spec <- c("x + y <= 10", "x >= 1", "y >= 1")
	latte_count(spec)
  You shouldn't get any errors.
